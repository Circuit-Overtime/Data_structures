# Data Structures and Algorithms in C

This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in C. It aims to provide a comprehensive collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms that are commonly used in computer science.

## Data Structures Implemented

- Linked List
- Queue
- Stack
- Tree

## Algorithms Implemented

- Sorting
- Searching

## Usage

Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in separate files. You can explore each implementation to understand how it works and how it can be used. Additionally, each implementation is well-commented for clarity and understanding.
